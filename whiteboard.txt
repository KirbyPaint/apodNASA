Ideas for web application

- APOD for each day you've had a birthday. (Starting June 1995, up to 2020).
- Random Images with count (at some max)
- Singular day search, with extended information

Stretch Goals

- Date ranges
- Search images by title (with title parameter)?
- Birthday image can tell whether or not the user has already had a current year's birthday
- Explanation pop-up for users for instructions on using the site

Notes

- On any feature, check if video, if video -> present link to video. Otherwise, show image.
- Headpoint is received as a singular object if single date is pulled. Head point is received as an array of objects if multiple dates are pulled.
